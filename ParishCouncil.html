                    <p>Neil Koorbanally grew up in Chatsworth, where he was part of the St. John's Catholic Parish. He spent time a few years at Holy Trinity and the Good Shepherd Parish
                         in Phoenix while at University before joining St. Josephs at the end of 1999, where he remained a parishioner for some 26 years to date. He is an Organic Chemist by
                          training and lectures at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, where he has worked for the past 25 years, playing roles in different management positions for the past 10 years
                          . He is married to Chantal Koorbanally and have one son, James Koorbanally, who grew up at St. Josephs Parish and is now 18 years old. He enjoys swimming and is an avid Liverpool supporter.</p>

                    <p>My name is Candice Zulu. I am married to Thembinkosi Zulu and we are blessed with three beautiful daughters.</p><br>
                    <p>Although I wasn't born Catholic, I was baptised into the faith at the age of 10. From a young age, I have felt drawn to the Church. In 1997, I became the first female altar server at Emmanuel Cathedral under Archbishop Denis Hurley, a significant moment in my faith journey. As a teenager, I also worked in the church office during school holidays, deepening my connection with the parish.</p><br>
                    <p>I joined St Joseph's parish in 2014 and spent some time simply attending Mass. Eventually, I surrendered to God's call and opened myself to becoming an active missionary disciple. I began to say “yes” more, to talks, events, and opportunities to serve.</p><br>
                    <p>I am currently part of the Baptism Prep team, serve as a Eucharistic Minister, and am involved in the Sacristans ministry as well as L.I.F.T (Ladies in Faith Together).</p><br>
                    <p>This is my second term on the PPC. I look forward to serving my parish community with love, intention, and faith.</p><br>

                    <p>Ryan Joseph Abrahams</p><br>
                    <p>I have been part of the Parish of St Joseph since 2002. I have always been drawn to serve in the church and begun doing so soon after joining this parish. 23 years later, I still try to be involved wherever God deems fit.</p><br>
                    <p>I have been involved in Lifeteen, Catechism, Young Adults, Alpha and various prayer ministries. I have also assisted pilgrims in their preparation for World Youth Day.</p><br>
                    <p>In the Mass ministries, I have been involved in training of Sacristans, Ministers of Hospitality, Ministers of the Word and Ministers of the Eucharist, serving in those capacities as required. I am also installed as an Acolyte at the Saturday 5pm Mass.</p><br>
                    <p>My favourite verse in scripture comes from Paul's letter to the Romans, Chapter 3, Verse 23:</p><br>
                    <p>For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.</p><br>
                    <p>It is a reminder that I must never let ego get in the way of service. In naming the various works that I am or have been involved in, it is merely context for the question:</p><br>
                    <p>How may I be of service to you?</p><br>
                    <p>In this Jubilee Year of Hope, I pray that God bolster hope within us all. That our service points to Jesus in Hope, Love and Peace. Amen</p><br>

                    <p>I joined the Parish of St Joseph's in 2018. I began my ministry journey as a Minister of Hospitality. In recent years, I have had the privilege of serving as an Extraordinary Minister of the Eucharist as well as an Acolyte.</p><br>
                    <p>Outside of parish life, I have been blessed with an amazing Wife and daughter. I'm a registered professional in the Civil Engineering field and try to live my faith both within and beyond the walls of the church.</p><br>
                    <p>It is a privilege to walk this journey with others who are seeking to know and follow Christ more deeply.</p><br>
                    <p>One of my favorite scriptures is:</p><br>

                    <p>Hi family in Christ, my name is Lloyd Augustine.</p><br>
                    <p>I have been a member of St. Joseph's Parish since 2018 and am actively involved in various ministries. Serving and engaging with the Catholic community is deeply important to me, as I believe in fostering a welcoming, vibrant, and faith-filled environment for all.</p><br>
                    <p>I have a particular passion for involving our youth in every aspect of parish life. They are not only the future of the Church—they are also its present—and I strive to create opportunities for them to participate meaningfully in our shared mission.</p><br>
                    <p>With a professional background in training, business development, and community engagement, I bring a structured and initiative-driven approach to my ministry work. I enjoy creating programs and opportunities that support our parish's growth, especially those that empower individuals to transition from a place of need to one of self-reliance and purpose.</p><br>
                    <p>Above all, I am grateful that Jesus does not call me to perfection, but to obedience and faithfulness. Even when I stumble, I am reminded</p><br>

                    <p>My name is Amy-Grace Bessick and I am a Journalism graduate from Rhodes University. I am passionate about the Catholic faith and enjoy making art in the traditional sense through painting, writing and singing but also in the online spaces for sharing the gospel and growing God's Kingdom.
                        I enjoy spending time watching series while yapping with my loud, large family. If I'm not on a catch up session with one of my besties, you will find my nose buried deep in a fiction book or watching my favourite YouTubers vlogs.
                        I want to encourage other young Catholics to foster a personal relationship with Christ and become a reflection of Him in their lives and to all those they meet.”

                    <p>My name is Kim Vere. I'm married to Donavan, and we're blessed with two amazing children. From a young age, I've always felt connected to the church—starting in the children's, youth, and family choirs. I've also had the privilege of performing in The Witness and playing a lead role in Forever Home. Over the years, I've served on the ACTS Core team and was honored to be called as a co-director.</p><br>
                    <p>Since 2021, I've been a devoted member of St Joseph's, serving in various ministries such as the social committee, Alpha, Alpha Marriage, and as a Eucharistic Minister. I have a heart for ministry and a passion for supporting the church's mission to share God's love.</p><br>
                    <p>Outside of church, I'm involved in KZN soccer, where I serve on the EXCO and manage a girls U13 team. I love spending time with my family and watching my children grow. I'm truly grateful to be part of a church community that grows in faith and walks together in Christ's love.</p><br>

                    <p>My faith journey began with an Anglican baptism, but frequent moves during my childhood due to my dad's job meant limited church attendance growing up. This changed when I entered RCIA in 2011, completing my Catholic formation in 2012 and finding my spiritual home at St. Joseph Parish in 2014, where I have been an active member ever since.</p><br>
                    <p>My passion for coffee led me to run He-Brews Coffee Shop right here at St. Joseph, combining my love for great coffee with bringing our parish community together.</p><br>
                    <p>Married to Annie, I'm a devoted father to two young daughters who keep me busy when I'm not cheering on Chelsea or catching the latest action movies and series. My life reflects a beautiful blend of faith, family, business, and the simple pleasures that make each day meaningful.</p><br>
