            <h2>BECOMING A CATHOLIC</h2>
            
            <div class="text-block">
                <p>Maybe you've attended Mass with us for a while or maybe you've just met a Catholic friend and you were intrigued by her faith.
                     Perhaps you were baptised Catholic as a child, attended some Catechism classes but you have not really been practising the Faith
                      these last few years. Perhaps you have an inclination towards the Faith you cannot quite explain it but there is just this 
                      unshakeable question lingering on your mind;</p>
            </div>

            <h3><strong> DO I BECOME A CATHOLIC?</strong></h3>
            
            <div class="text-block">
                <p>If you're feeling a little tug at your heart strings calling you back to the Church or, if you are not Catholic, to the Church,
                     then you are at the right place. The Holy Spirit is relentlessly in pursuit of you; calling you to the arms of the Father and
                      drawing you back to His family.</p>
            </div>

            <h3><strong>So, where do you start?</strong></h3>
            
            <div class="text-block">
                <p>We are all at different stages in our spiritual journeys so there is not just one answer to this. The important thing is just that…
                    to start! Regardless of your past, or how long you’ve been away from God, the church is not the same without you and we are excited
                     to have you as a part of this universal family. So to get on the track you could start by connecting with the Parish Priest,
                      Father Brett Williams or with his Assistant, Father.Mtshengiseni Dlamini or with Carmel Michael the RCIA, (Rite of Christian
                       Initiation of Adults Coordinator) and schedule a meeting with any one of them and the local community more intimately.</p>
            </div>

            <h3><strong>How will it happen?</strong></h3>
            
            <div class="text-block">
                <p>Jesus turned and saw them following. “What do you want?” He asked. They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you
                     staying?” “Come and see,” He replied. So they went and saw where He was staying, and spent that day with Him.</p>
            </div>

            <h3><strong>You are invited to our “Come and See” sessions before committing to your faith journey. Look out for the invitation.</strong></h3>
            
            <div class="text-block">
                <p>There are a series of classes and open discussions that will help you understand the beauty of Church teachings, the mystery of the
                     Sacraments and the richness of Sacred Scripture. During these discussions, you are most welcome to ask questions you may have about
                      faith and also meet others who are interested in the Faith and may be on a similar journey. If you are not Baptised, RCIA will help
                       you prepare to receive the Sacraments of Initiation: Baptism, Confirmation and the Eucharist which usually happens during the
                        Easter Vigil.</p>
                <p>If you have been Baptised in an alternate Christian denomination, RCIA will help you to enter into full communion with the Catholic
                     Christian Church by celebrating the Sacraments of Confirmation and the Eucharist.</p>
