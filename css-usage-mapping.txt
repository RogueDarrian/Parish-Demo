CSS selector usage mapping — precise per-page mapping

Pages scanned:
- BecomeParish.html
- Clergy.html
- ContactUs.html
- home page.html
- MessageFather.html
- OurParish.html
- ParishCouncil.html
- ParishReg.html

Notes:
- Mapping lists class selectors found in `Parish.css` and the pages where that class appears.
- If a CSS selector exists but does not appear in any HTML file, it is listed as "(unused in pages)".
- Class name matching is exact: HTML class values are case-sensitive for CSS selectors in XHTML and practically case-sensitive for reliable results; there is one naming mismatch called out below.

---
Shared / header & nav (appear on nearly all pages):
- .hero: BecomeParish, Clergy, ContactUs, home page, MessageFather, OurParish, ParishCouncil, ParishReg
- .navbar: all pages above
- .logo: all pages above
- .nav-menu: all pages above
- .dropdown: all pages above
- .dropbtn: all pages above
- .dropdown-menu: all pages above
- .nav-menu li: all pages above (implicit via class usage)

Footer / social (shared):
- .social-footer: BecomeParish, Clergy, ContactUs, home page, MessageFather, OurParish, ParishCouncil, ParishReg
- .footer-container: same (all pages)
- .footer-title: same
- .social-icons: same
- .social-icon: same
- .social-icon .fa-*: icons appear (Font Awesome classes inside <i>), but these are provided by FA library, not in Parish.css

Site utilities:
- .scroll-top: Clergy, ContactUs, MessageFather, OurParish, ParishCouncil, ParishReg, BecomeParish (present on many pages; NOT present on home page)
- .btn: (defined in CSS) — not found as class in any HTML page scanned (unused)

Home / landing selectors (home page and others):
- .cards-section: home page
- .cards-grid: home page
- .card, .card-blue, .card-orange, .card-green, .card-red, .card-icon: home page
- .mission-section: home page, OurParish
- .mission-subtitle: home page, OurParish
- .mission-text: home page, ParishReg, OurParish
- .info-section: home page
- .plife: home page
- .parish-life-images: home page

Services / cards (home page):
- .services-grid: home page
- .service-card: home page
- .image-container: home page
- .service-title: home page
- .service-description: home page
- .service-button: home page

Content pages:
- .p-container: OurParish
- .p-content: OurParish
- .p-image-container: OurParish

Clergy page selectors (Clergy.html):
- .clergy-container: Clergy
- .clergy-profile: Clergy
- .clergy-profile.reverse: Clergy (used via class="clergy-profile reverse")
- .profile-image: Clergy
- .profile-content: Clergy
- .section-title: Clergy, MessageFather (both pages use this class)
- .clergy-name: Clergy
- .bio-text: Clergy

Parish Council selectors (ParishCouncil.html):
- .ParishCouncil-container: ParishCouncil
- .team-grid: ParishCouncil
- .team-member: ParishCouncil
- .member-info: ParishCouncil
- .member-name: ParishCouncil
- .member-position: ParishCouncil
- .bio-section: ParishCouncil
- .bio-item: ParishCouncil
- .bio-header: ParishCouncil
- .arrow: ParishCouncil
- .name: ParishCouncil
- .bio-content: ParishCouncil
- .bio-item.expanded: ParishCouncil (by class="bio-item expanded")
- .congratulations, .congrats-title, .congrats-text: ParishCouncil

Note: class name mismatch found — HTML uses `class="Council-Bio-container"` (capital B) while CSS declares `.Council-bio-container` (lowercase b). Because CSS class selectors are case-sensitive in XML/XHTML and some environments, this is likely a bug: the CSS rule will not match the HTML element. Recommend renaming either HTML or CSS to match (preferred: change HTML to `Council-bio-container` or change CSS to `.Council-Bio-container`).

Registration page selectors (ParishReg.html):
- .hero-section: ParishReg
- .mission-text: ParishReg
- .hands-image: ParishReg
- .registration-section: ParishReg
- .btn-register: ParishReg
- .bottom-images, .bottom-image: ParishReg
- .broken-hearted (span) appears in ParishReg content (used inside paragraph)

Become a Catholic page (BecomeParish.html):
- .content-wrapper: BecomeParish
- .left-column, .right-column: BecomeParish
- .text-block: BecomeParish
- .video-section, .video-container, .video-placeholder, .play-button: BecomeParish
- .responsive-iframe (iframe class on embedded iframe) — this is inline style in page but not in Parish.css

MessageFather page selectors (MessageFather.html):
- .fathercontent-section: MessageFather
- .section-title: MessageFather (also used in Clergy)
- .greeting: MessageFather
- .message-text: MessageFather
- .closing: MessageFather
- .mission-statement-section, .mission-container, .mission-description: MessageFather
- .broken-hearted: MessageFather (span)

Contact page selectors (ContactUs.html):
- .contact-section: ContactUs
- .contact-container: ContactUs
- .contact-grid: ContactUs
- .contact-column: ContactUs
- .phone-label: ContactUs
- .zapper-block: ContactUs (inline class present)
- .cta-banner, .cta-content, .call-button: ContactUs
- .mass-times-section, .mass-times-container, .mass-times-left, .mass-schedule, .mass-time, .confession-time, .mass-times-right: ContactUs

Other selectors present in CSS but not used in any HTML scanned (unused):
- .btn (no HTML pages use class="btn")
- .card p vendor-specific line-clamp properties are part of card but if card isn't used they are unused; however card is used on home page so not entirely unused.
- Any other very small helper classes may be unused; search results above cover the major ones.

---
Summary:
- Shared across all pages: header/nav (.hero, .navbar, .logo, .nav-menu, .dropdown, .dropbtn, .dropdown-menu) and footer (.social-footer, .footer-container, .footer-title, .social-icons, .social-icon).
- Page-specific groups: Clergy (.clergy-*), ParishCouncil (.team-*, .bio-*), OurParish (.p-*), BecomeParish (.content-wrapper, .video-*), ParishReg (.registration-section, .btn-register), Contact (.contact-*, .mass-times-*, .cta-*)
- Action items: fix class name capitalization mismatch: `Council-Bio-container` (HTML) vs `.Council-bio-container` (CSS).

If you want, I can:
- Split the CSS into `shared.css` + per-page CSS files and update each HTML to only load necessary files (saves bytes and improves clarity). I can implement that now.
- Or I can fix the `Council-Bio-container` mismatch in the HTML or CSS.
